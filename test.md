## GENERAL

Prior to affecting coordination, inform the other ATC of the type of coordination that is about to take place; Ideally, include the type of coordination in the initial call to the ATC. This is to allow that controller to appropriately place you in a priority Que.  
Example "Something-North, Me-South. Point-Out..."  
The following are examples of the most common types of coordination:  
 - APREQ “App Wreck”
 - Point-Out
 - Request
 - Position Assumption/Closing
 - Release Request
 - Information
    - Note: "Information" is a general coordination type that doesn’t require any approvals or other information from the controller you are calling. I.e. “Rolling Call”, Min Fuel, or “Missed Approach” would be under the coordination title “Information”.  

When you need to interrupt another coordination that is taking place for your higher priority item, you may speak over the other coordination and start the coordination with one of the two following statements.  
Use of this overriding authority should be limited to situations where separation may be lost or an  emergency is taking place where time is off the essence.  
 - “Break for Control…”
 - “Emergency…”

When you are speaking about an aircraft to another controller but it is not required that the other controller actually see the aircraft yet (Ex: CTR speaking to DEL about a specific flight strip that was just printed or CTR to CTR concerning changing an aircraft’s route while in the next CTR’s airspace), preface the Callsign and coordination information with the word “Reference”.  
Examples:
 - “Salt Lake Local, Stockton. Information...”
 - “Reference DAL1234 has declared Low Fuel. ETA 25min.”

## GROUND-2-GROUND COORDINATION FORMAT Part 1

General transcript format:
 - Person initiating coordination: “(Facility name of person to be called), (facility name of person calling). (Type of coordination).”
 - Person being called: “(facility name)”
 - person initiating: “(message)”
 - (negotiation of the coordination, if any)
 - person being called: “(controller initials)”
 - person initiating: “(controller initials)”

Example:
 - SLC_TWR to GUNNISON SECTOR: “Gunnison. Salt Lake Local. APREQ.”
 - GUNNISON SECTOR: “Gunnison.”
 - SLC_TWR: “Air-Gun71 APREQ unrestricted climb to 17,000.”
 - GUNNISON: “Air-Gun71 unable. Unrestricted up to 10,000 approved.”
 - SLC_TWR: “Unrestricted approved up to 10,000.”
 - GUNNISON: “KL”
 - SLC_TWR: “KF”

## APPROVAL REQUEST (APREQ) “APP WRECK”

An APREQ is a coordination request with the next sector or ATC that an aircraft will enter and requires approval for the specific operation.
These operations can include but are not limited to: Non-Standard Operations, Deviations from Letters of Agreement, Non-RVSM aircraft in RVSM airspace, requesting a block of airspace, Inappropriate Altitude For Direction Of Flight (IAFDOF) “Eye Off Doff”, etc…  
Examples:
 - “APREQ, N928X climbing to 11,000”
 - “APREQ, UAL452 IAFDOF FL190 due to weather”
 - “APREQ, SWA8832 direct AKO VOR/DME”
 - “APREQ, N234BB Negative RVSM FL290”
 - “APREQ, Block 15,000 and below for an Austin departure to JWELL and then turning north eastbound”

Appropriate responses to approving an APREQ:
 - (Callsign) Approved as requested
 - (Callsign) (repeated request) Approved.

The appropriate responses to denying an APREQ:
 - (Callsign) Unable
 - (Callsign) Unable. (amended/compromised request) Approved.

Example:
 - SLC_TWR: “Air-Gun71 APREQ unrestricted climb to 17,000.”
 - GUNNISON: “Air-Gun71 unable. Unrestricted up to 10,000 approved.”

## REQUEST

Rule of thumb for distinguishing the difference between REQUEST and APREQ:
 - Requests are made to the sector you are getting the aircraft FROM. (where the A/C is now)
 - APREQs are made to the sector your are giving the aircraft TO. (where the A/C will be)

When Ground Control is requesting permission to cross a runway from Local Control, this is considered a “Request”.  
Example:
 - GC: “Local Center, Ground West. Request.”
 - LC: "Center."
 - GC: "2 to cross runway 16L at H10."
 - LC: "After landing A320; short final, crossing approved."

In the airborne environment, a Request is a request made to the sector that has control of an aircraft prior to it entering your sector. These requests must be made sparingly and only when the action cannot be reasonably completed in your airspace.  
Examples:
 - “Request AAL1234 at FL200 for direction of flight and low altimeters”
 - “Request DAL8745 direct DTA VORTAC for traffic.”

A request can also be made once communication change to you has already occurred.  
Unless covered by an SOP/LOA or pre-coordinated scenario, request "control" from the previous sector to change the current condition of the aircraft that will effect the sectors airspace that they are still in.  
Example requests:
 - “Request control, AAL123, climb to FL320”
 - “Request control, AAL123, descent to FL320”
 - “Request control, AAL123, turns to the west”
 - “Request control, AAL123, beacon change”
 - “Request control, AAL123, speed”
 - “Request control, AAL123” (this includes all aspects of control)

Example responses:
 - "AAL123, your control for climb to FL320"
 - "AAL123, your control for climb"
 - "DAL123, your control for speed"
 - "DAL123, your control for turn up to 20 degrees right"
 - "DAL123, your control for right turns"
 - "DAL123, your control for turns"
 - "SWA123, your control"

If the sector you are requesting control from sees a potential conflict with your request for control, the sector may reference an aircraft to maintain separation from prior to releasing the control of the aircraft to you by using the prefixing terms "Reference Traffic"; In this situation, utilize the “Traffic Observed” coordination found in the Point-Out section.  
Examples:
 - HUDSON: "AAL123, Request control for descent."
   - WARREN: "Reference traffic, north of AAL123 by 7 miles, SWA2332 FL310."
   - HUDSON: "SWA2332, traffic observed"
   - WARREN: "AAL123, your control for descent"
    - Hudson is now required to ensure separation from SWA2332 by only descending AAL123 once clear of SWA2332.
 - LC_E: "N123AB, request control."
   - LC_W: "Reference traffic, on the upwind a skyhawk turning left crosswind at the ship-yard"
   - LC_E: "Traffic observed"
   - LC_W: "N123AB, your control"

If you have time, it may be adventitious to scan the sector you are about to call and see if what you are about to request control for will create any potential conflicts and preemptively reference the traffic with the initial request.  
Examples:
 - HUDSON: "AAL123, Request control for descent with respect to SWA2332."
   - WARREN: "With respect to SWA2332, AAL123 your control for descent."
 - HUDSON: "AAL123, Request control for descent with respect to SWA2332."
   - WARREN: "I will be turning SWA2332 to the left in a moment."
   - HUDSON: "Roger, I will wait for the turn to see what it looks like before I descend."
   - WARREN: "With respect to SWA2332, AAL123 your control for descent."

## POINT-OUT

Ideally, you will utilize the Point-Out function (QP command in vERAM) to force a Full Datablock (FDB) onto the controller’s scope prior to starting coordination concerning a RADAR target.  
This is not always possible because of limitations (real world) between different types of facilities.  
For example, if an ERAM (ARTCC) facility sends an automated Point-Out to a facility that does not use ERAM, such as TRACONs/Towers or other country’s Centers like Mexico and Canada, the other facility will not receive it, and vice versa.  

When approving a point-out, the appropriate format for the response is: “(Callsign or Beacon Code) Point-Out Approved”
 - Note: If within the same ERAM facility, you may use CID in place of callsign.

When initiating a point-out with a controller that has a possible conflict with your point-out, that controller may elect to either convert the point-out to a handoff by replying “(Callsign) RADAR Contact” or they might “reference” traffic to you in the same manner that was covered in the "request" section.  
Example:
 - BEAR: “Gunnison, Bear, Point-Out.”
 - GUNNISON: “Gunnison”
 - BEAR: “Southeast BEARR intersection, AAL123. FL190. Direct Fairfield VORTAC”
 - GUNNISON: “Reference Traffic Northwest Salt Lake Airport, DAL745. 17,300 Climbing FL200. Northwest-bound.”
 - BEAR: “DAL745 traffic observed”
 - GUNNISON: “AAL123 point-out approved, KF”
 - BEAR: “KC”

## HANDOFF

When accepting a manual handoff of an aircraft, the appropriate format for the response is:
 - “(Callsign or Beacon Code) RADAR Contact”

---

## GROUND-2-GROUND COORDINATION FORMAT Part 2

Utilize the acronym T.W.W.A.D (“Tee-Wod”) to assist in appropriate coordination formats.  
Some of the following items are not always needed, depending on the situation and type of coordination.  
T = Type of coordination  
W = Where to Look  
W = Who to look for  
A = Altitude information  
D = Direction of flight/route  
     

 - TYPE:
   - "(you), (me). (type of coordination)."
     - “Stockton, Gunnison. Handoff.”
   - Once the controller answers your request to start coordinating, follow through with the following items.

 - WHERE:
   - State the distance and direction of the reference target from a NAVAID/Fix that is shown on both ATC RADAR displays.
     - “8 miles northeast OGD VORTAC, etc…”
   - The Distance may be omitted if utilizing the Point-Out/Full Datablock function.
     - “northeast OGD VORTAC, etc…”
 - WHO:
   - State the type of target to look for, as appropriate (Primary Target, Beacon Code and/or Callsign).
   - If you and the controller are both simulating use of ERAM and the aircrafts’ route will take them within approx 60 miles of your border, you may state the Callsign only.
     - “Primary Target, etc…”
     - “Primary Target is AAL7564, etc…”
     - “Beacon 1235, etc…”
     - “Beacon 1235 is AAL7564, etc…” “AAL7564, etc…”
   - When referencing the target to a facility that does not use the same RADAR System as yours, you must reference the beacon code if the aircraft's flight plan and hard-assigned altitude does not take them through the facility.
     - “Beacon 1235, etc…”
 - ALTITUDE:
   - State the current verified MODE-C altitude response. This may be omitted if the other controller is the same facility as you, as the altitude information is being gathered from the same source.
     - “One-Zero thousand, six hundred.”
   - If the aircraft is not level at an altitude, inform the other ATC of the aircraft’s climbing/descending status and the assigned altitude.
     - “Climbing one-two thousand”
     - “One-zero thousand, six hundred. Climbing one-two thousand”
     - “One-zero thousand, six hundred. Climbing via SID”
   - For Point-outs, the altitude(s) in which the pilot will be operating within the ATC’s airspace is required to be stated.
     - “One-zero thousand, six hundred. Climbing 11,000”
     - “One-zero thousand, six hundred. Climbing/Descending above/below your airspace”
 - DIRECTION:
   - If appropriate (usually during point-outs), state the appropriate flight path information that affects their sector.
   - During handoff coordination, state the next fix that the aircraft is to progress. This may be omitted if the aircraft is on a route that is defined by LOA or is clearly shown in their flight strip.
     - “Direct Milford VOR DME”
     - “On the Delta Arrival.”
   - During point-out coordination, inform the other ATC of the current route, next fix, and/or cardinal direction.
     - “J58 to Milford VOR DME”
     - “Direct Milford VOR DME”
     - “Eastbound”

EXAMPLES:
 - HANDOFF
   - ARTCC to ARTCC (Inter-facility)
     - “Handoff, 11 miles southwest Milford VORTAC. AAL123. FL320.”
     - “Handoff, 11 miles southwest Milford VORTAC. AAL123. FL326 climbing FL340.”
   - ARTCC to ARTCC (intra-facility)
     - “Handoff, 11 miles southwest Milford VORTAC. AAL123.”
     - “Handoff, 11 miles southwest Milford VORTAC. AAL123. Climbing FL340.”
   - ARTCC to TRACON
     - “Handoff, 11 miles south FRNZY. Beacon 1324 is AAL123. FL193. Descending 17,000.”
     - “Handoff, 11 miles south FRNZY. Beacon 1324 is AAL123. FL193. Descending 17,000. Direct FRNZY.”
   - TRACON to ARTCC
     - “Handoff, 8 miles northeast Ogden VORTAC. Beacon 1324 is AAL123. FL193. Climbing FL230.”

     - “Handoff, northwest Ogden VORTAC. AAL123. Descending 11,000. Direct BUBBY”
 - POINT-OUT
   - ARTCC to ARTCC (Inter-facility)
     - (Force AAL123 FDB)

## RELEASE REQUEST

By default, all Local (TWR) controllers must request a “Release” of an IFR departure (local SOPs/LOAs may illustrate situations where this is not required).  
A standard Release Request call will happen like so:
 - TWR: “(departure position), (your position). Release Request”
 - DEP: (answers with their position name)
 - TWR: “Request Release (aircraft full callsign) to (aircraft’s destination airport). (anything else that your local SOPs/LOAs require)”
 - DEP: “(aircraft full callsign) released. (operator initials)”
 - TWR: “(operator initials)”

Example:
 - TWR: “Lake, Ogden Local. Release Request”
 - DEP: “Lake”
 - TWR: “Request Release N123AB to Wendover Airport.”
 - DEP: “N123AB released. NB”
 - TWR: “JP”

---

## ROLLING CALLS


In order to assist in the RADAR Identification of IFR aircraft departing a field that does not have an automated system in place (7110.65 5-3-2), Local Control (TWR) must issue a “Rolling Call”.  
This call must be issued after the aircraft is witnessed starting their takeoff roll and prior to 1 mile of the takeoff runway end.  
Local Directives may provide situations where rolling calls are not required.  

A rolling call should follow a format as so:
 - TWR: “(departure position), (your position). Information.”
 - DEP: (answers with their position name)
 - TWR: “(aircraft full callsign) Rolling.”
 - DEP: “(operator initials)”
 - TWR: “(operator initials)”

Example:
 - TWR: “Lake, Ogden Local. Information”
 - DEP: “Lake”
 - TWR: “N123AB Rolling.”
 - DEP: “NB”
 - TWR: “JP”

The previous template is the FORMAL way to conduct the Rolling Call; the less formal and more popular method is the “Lazy Shout-Line” format where the initiating controller does not wait for the response from the receiving controller before giving the information needed.  
This type of coordination is highly discouraged with any other type of coordination but is usually acceptable for Rolling Calls due to the small amount of information actually being transmitted and is usually expected by the receiving controller.  
Consult your local staff and directives for further information.
 - TWR: “(departure position), (your position). (aircraft full callsign) Rolling.”
 - DEP: “(operator initials)”
 - TWR: “(operator initials)”

Example:
 - TWR: “Lake, Ogden Local. N123AB Rolling”
 - DEP: “NB”
 - TWR: “JP”
